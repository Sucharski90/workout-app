### PROJECT GOALS

1. Create an API using `Express.js` that possesses full CRUD functionalities.
- POST creates new routines and new users.
- GET retrieves exercises for a routine, and user data.
- PUT updates the names of existing routines the user saved.
- DELETE removes existing routines.
2. Create a `React.js` application that presents the API's data in a user-friendly way.

### APPROACH

Primarily, we want this app. to be convenient for the user.

The ideal scenario for this app. to be used is before and during a workout with either a beginner or veteran.

The app. allows the user to build a complete routine on the fly, and possibly save that routine for later reference.

Keeping this in mind, we want to reduce the number of "screens" the user will need to use. This way, the user is focused on working out, and not on navigating the application.

The app. features log-in functionality as a way to save routines; however, logging in is not mandatory if the user has no intention of saving their routine.
